# Content of Google Drive folder appears instead of folder itself

If you find yourself looking at the content of a shared Google Drive folder \(instead of the folder itself\), downloading all its files might seem like a daunting task. Luckily, you can still download the entire Google Drive folder \(instead of downloading every file one at a time.\)

## Downloading a shared folder

1. In Google Drive, click the drop-down arrow next to the name of the folder \(see image below.\)
2. In the fly-out menu, select Download.
