# Content of Google Drive folder appears instead of folder itself

If you find yourself looking at the content of a Google Drive folder \(instead of the folder itself\), downloading all its files one at a time might seem like a daunting task. Luckily, you can still download the entire Google Drive folder \(instead of downloading each file individually.\)

## Downloading a shared folder

1. In Google Drive, click the **drop-down arrow** next to the name of the shared folder \(see image below.\)
2. In the fly-out menu, select **Download**. Google Drive will zip the file before proceeding with the download process. Zip and download times will vary depending on the size of the folder and network speed.
3. When the download is complete, a ZIP file will appear in your **Downloads** folder. Double-click the ZIP file to uncompress the folder.
